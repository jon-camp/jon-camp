# Core Needs: BICEPS

*Originally from https://www.palomamedina.com/biceps/*

There are six core needs researchers find are important for humans (both at work and in our personal lives). Each of us have a personal hierarchy for the six however; this is mine. I've ranked the categories and also struck out a few bullet points that don't particularly resonate with me.

# Choice

* Choice: Having flexibility, the chance to have more control over key parts of your world.

* Autonomy: Having clear ownership over a domain where you can do as you wish, without asking for permission.

* Decision-making: The ability to make decisions about the things that matter to you.

# Significance

* Status: You hold a title/role that honors your worth among your peers/your industry.

* ~~Visibility: Your work is highly visible to people that matter.~~

* Recognition: Your work is recognized and appreciated in ways that feel good.  

# Predictability

* Resources: There’s enough certainty about resources (money, personnel hours, space) so you can focus on your job or goals.

* Time: There’s certainty about when things will occur/when you can prepare for them.

* Future challenges: You can anticipate and thus can prepare for future challenges.

* Direction: Goals, strategy, and direction stay consistent and don’t change too often/fast.


# Equality/Fairness

* ~~Access to resources (money, time, space, etc) feels fair/equitable.~~

* Access to information feels fair: All groups/people have access to information that is relevant to them.

* Equal reciprocity: You support each other equally.

* Decisions are fair and everyone is treated as equally important.

# Belonging

* ~~Community: A feeling of friendship and closeness with a group, or being part of a tight community of any size.~~

* Community well-being: People are cared for, the whole group feels happy and healthy.

* ~~Connection: Feeling kinship and mutual understanding with another person.~~

# Improvement/Progress

* Progress towards purpose: You are helping make progress towards an important goal for the company, your team or your own career/life.

* Improving the lives of others: You see how your work helps improve things for others.

* ~~Personal growth: Learning/seeing fast growth in yourself in skills that matter to you.~~
